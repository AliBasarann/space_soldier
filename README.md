/*
Hi, this is a small project I enjoyed while I working on it. 

Space soldier is a arcade game which can be played on terminal.

First, you should enter 2 integers which specify height and width of the meteor rush,
then you should write one more integer to specify distance between your spaceship and meteor rush.

When game starts you can go right with command "right", go left with command "left", fire with command "fire"
Meteors will come a bit closer every five rounds, be careful, don't hit them!!!

You can always exit with command "exit"

Have fun :)
